        <h2>Design Principles</h2>
        <p>King Dot uses the unified style of basic design elements, focuses on user experience and interaction, establishes stable and flexible design, and solves design problems for users.</p>
        <h3>Clarity</h3>
        <ul class="design-list">
            <li>Design expression: the expression of design is clear and clear, so that users can quickly understand and use it.</li>
            <li>Color contrast: highlight the visual effect of color, which is more readable in visual interaction. For example, the success message will be indicated in light green, which is more in line with the user's logic. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <ul class="design-list">
            <li>Process simplification: simple and intuitive processes help users improve efficiency, so they have more time to do valuable things.</li>
            <li>Intelligent help: help users work smarter and more efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Consistent</h3>
        <ul class="design-list">
            <li>Consistent behavior: fully check the user's behavior with human-computer interaction, button feedback, functional behavior, experience and understand the user's behavior habits, and reduce the user's learning cost.</li>
            <li>Consistent interface: consistent design of functions, elements and structures in the product. For example, buttons, margins, colors, etc. will appear repeatedly to enhance consistency.</li>
            <li>Consistent life: the most important vision in the design should be consistent with the natural life in terms of layout, color and icon, so as to reduce the cost of user authentication. Create a product experience closer to life. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interaction</h3>
        <ul class="design-list">
            <li>Visual interaction: color is a very subjective thing, and the meaning of a certain color is different. You can choose your favorite style theme.</li>
            <li>Page feedback: when operating a function, observe the change of the page. Timely feedback the current function status.</li>
        </ul>
